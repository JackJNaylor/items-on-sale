## Items on Sale Microservice
### By Jack Naylor

This project is a sample of an ecommerce microservice. The microservice provides an API for users to get reccomended items on sale based on the user's previous orders and product ratings for those orders, a user's "Wish List", and highly rated items from other users which are considered "Hot Deals". The microservice "interacts" with microservices for getting the user's order history, their wish list and current items on sale, all of which are stubbed so the Items on Sale service can act on it's own. 

The microservice is documented with OpenAPI Specification.

The microservice was built using Spring Boot with Maven dependency management.
